# The Interstate Gamers Website  
This repo contains the underlying code for The Interstate Gamers Podcast website. The site was originally coded in pure HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, but has recently been upgraded to utilize TypeScript. While the site has already been released to the public, it is still a work in progress (WIP).
